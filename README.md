# GettingandCleaningData
Repo for Course Project

Instructions for using run_analysis.R

If you have already downloaded Samsung data you can skip the first lines of the script.
For convenience I have left them as comments so you can use this part of script as well.
By using this part of the script it will download and store the data in a folder called
CouseProjectData in your current working directory.

The execution of the rest of the script will provide the answers for each question of the
Course Project. 

So the script will make available the Views of Dataset (that is all datas), Extracted_Dataset
(that is the mean and StDvs of Question 2 where the labels have been changed accordingly.

Moreover, the execution of the code will store the Tidy_Data_Set in your working directory.


Good Luck !
