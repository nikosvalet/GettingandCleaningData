Definition of the variables as follows : 

X_test  = data frame for importing X_test.txt
y_test = data frame to import y_test.txt
subject_test = data frame to import source_test.txt


X_train  = data frame for importing X_train.txt
y_train = data frame to import y_train.txt
subject_train = data frame to import source_train.txt

features = data frame to import features.txt
activity_labels = data frame to import activity_labels.txt

C_X_test = data frame that adds subject and activity columns to the test data
C_X_train = data frame that adds subject and activity columns to the train data

Dataset = the complete set of data (test + train)

Extracet_Dataset = the subset of Dataset where columns contain "mean" or "std" in their label

Activity_names = temporary vector for grep function

Tidy = temporary data frame from group_by function
